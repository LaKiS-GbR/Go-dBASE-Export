This application is a simple tool to convert data from dBase/FoxPro databases to more modern formats. It can be operated in the CLI or via web interface. It is based on the free Golang library [go-dbase](github.com/Valentin-Kaiser/go-dbase) by LaKiS co-founder Valentin Kaiser.

## Build

```bash
cd cmd/
go build -o dbase-exporter
```
